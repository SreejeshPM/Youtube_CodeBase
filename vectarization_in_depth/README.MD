# Text Vectorization Concepts Demystified 📚

Welcome to the fascinating world of text vectorization! 🚀 This GitHub repository is your gateway to a series of captivating YouTube tutorials where we unravel the magic behind turning words into numbers.

## What's Inside 📦

In this series, we cover a range of text vectorization techniques, including:

1. **Bag of Words** 🎒
   - Discover how we break down the complexity of language into a simple, numeric representation.

2. **TF-IDF** 📈
   - Dive deep into Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to grasp the essence of this classic text vectorization approach.

3. **Word2Vec** 📝
   - Explore the two popular flavors of Word2Vec: Skip-gram and Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW). Learn how words get embedded into meaningful vectors.

4. **GloVe** ✋
   - Uncover the Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) method and see how it gives words a global perspective.

5. **FastText** 🚀
   - Get to know FastText, a text vectorization technique that handles subword information with finesse.

## Why Should You Care? 🤔
